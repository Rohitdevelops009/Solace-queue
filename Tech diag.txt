Here's a technical architecture for the AI-powered system that integrates Confluence, Jira, and GitHub for unified issue resolution:

### **Technical Architecture Overview**

#### 1. **Frontend Layer**
   - **React.js + TypeScript**: A user interface that allows users to input issues/queries and view consolidated, AI-generated responses.
   - **Features**:
     - Query input field
     - Display area for single-page summarized responses
     - Search functionality for past queries

#### 2. **Backend Layer**
   - **Node.js / Express.js**: Main backend framework for handling requests and orchestrating data flows between different services.
   - **GraphQL API Gateway**: Central point for data querying and aggregation from multiple sources.
   - **Python (FastAPI)**: For AI model integration and executing NLP processing tasks.

#### 3. **Data Integration and Extraction Modules**
   - **Integration Services**:
     - **Confluence Integration Module**: Uses Confluence REST API to search for and pull documentation relevant to user queries.
     - **Jira Integration Module**: Connects to Jira REST API to retrieve tickets, comments, task statuses, and metadata.
     - **GitHub Integration Module**: Interfaces with GitHub API to extract relevant code changes, pull requests, and commit data.
   - **Security**: 
     - **OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication with third-party APIs.
     - **JWT** for user session management.

#### 4. **Data Processing and AI Analysis Layer**
   - **NLP Pipelines**:
     - **Keyword Extraction & Semantic Search**:
       - **BERT or RoBERTa** for initial document and ticket retrieval.
     - **Summarization**:
       - **T5 or BART** models to condense and summarize data pulled from Confluence and Jira.
     - **Response Generation**:
       - **GPT-4** for synthesizing a human-like response that combines insights from all data sources.
     - **Semantic Similarity and Topic Detection**:
       - **Sentence Transformers (SBERT)** to identify recurring issues and cross-reference them with past tickets and code changes.
     - **NER**:
       - **spaCy** to identify and highlight key technical terms and components.
   - **Relevance Ranking**:
     - **Scikit-learn** or a custom ranking model to prioritize and filter the most important pieces of information.

#### 5. **Data Storage Layer**
   - **MongoDB**: Stores preprocessed query data, historical responses, and logs for quick access.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Maintains structured data like ticket metadata and user profiles.
   - **Redis**: Caches frequently accessed data to speed up query response times.

#### 6. **AI Model Hosting and Training Infrastructure**
   - **Azure Machine Learning / AWS SageMaker**: Platforms for training, deploying, and managing machine learning models.
   - **Docker**: Containerizes AI models and services to ensure consistency across development and production.
   - **Kubernetes**: Manages and orchestrates containerized services for scalability and reliability.

#### 7. **Notification and Reporting Services**
   - **Email Service**:
     - **SendGrid or AWS SES**: Used for sending automated email notifications with issue summaries and updates.
     - **NLP-based Email Generator**:
       - **GPT-3/GPT-4** for drafting well-structured email content.
   - **Integration with Dashboard**:
     - **Power BI** or **Grafana** to visualize ongoing and past issues, response times, and trends.

#### 8. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Grafana + Prometheus**: Real-time monitoring of system health, performance, and alerting for any anomalies.
   - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Centralized logging for analyzing logs, tracking errors, and troubleshooting.

#### 9. **Data Pipeline and Middleware**
   - **Apache Kafka**: Real-time streaming of data between services to ensure smooth communication and updates.
   - **Apache Camel**: Orchestrates and routes data integration across Confluence, Jira, and GitHub.

### **Technical Workflow**
1. **User Input**:
   - User enters an issue/query via the React.js frontend.
   - The input is sent to the backend API.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The backend triggers integration modules to fetch relevant data from Confluence, Jira, and GitHub using their APIs.
   - **OAuth 2.0** ensures secure access during API calls.

3. **AI Processing**:
   - The NLP pipelines analyze and process the extracted data:
     - Keyword extraction and semantic search identify relevant documents and tickets.
     - Summarization models condense the information.
     - GPT-based models generate a cohesive, single-page response.

4. **Response Delivery**:
   - The processed response is sent back to the frontend for user display.
   - The response includes recommended actions and key context.
   
5. **Email Notification**:
   - The system sends a summarized report to relevant stakeholders via SendGrid/AWS SES.

6. **Data Storage and Logging**:
   - The response and extracted data are stored in MongoDB and PostgreSQL for historical reference.
   - Logs are sent to ELK Stack for monitoring and analysis.

### **Security Measures**
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit to maintain data security.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access controls for different user levels.
- **API Security**: Use secure tokens (JWT) and OAuth 2.0 for API integrations. 

This architecture ensures an efficient, scalable, and secure system that effectively integrates multiple data sources and provides comprehensive, AI-driven responses.

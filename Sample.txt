**Issue:** Migration from Spring 5.x to Spring 6.x

**Consolidated Response:**

1. **Documentation Insights (Confluence):**
   - Refer to the detailed migration guide: *"Spring 5.x to 6.x Migration Best Practices"* (Confluence page link). Key changes include:
     - **Java Compatibility**: Spring 6.x requires Java 17 or higher.
     - **Jakarta EE Changes**: All `javax.*` packages have been replaced with `jakarta.*` packages, necessitating code adjustments for compatibility.
     - **Deprecated Features**: Review deprecated methods and classes in your current codebase; these may be removed in 6.x.
   - Migration checklist available under the *“Spring Migration Checklist”* page for a step-by-step approach.

2. **Related Tickets (Jira):**
   - Ticket **JIRA-12345**: *"Initial Assessment for Migration to Spring 6.x"* shows the analysis of potential code changes and dependency impacts.
   - Ticket **JIRA-12432**: *"Update internal libraries for Spring 6.x compatibility"* outlines completed tasks involving updates to core libraries used in your project.
   - Comments from previous migration tickets recommend testing the migration in a **staging environment** to avoid issues in production.

3. **Code Changes (GitHub Commits):**
   - Commit **`abc123`**: *“Refactor: Updated javax imports to jakarta imports”* provides an example of how to modify import statements. See the commit details for a template on making similar changes (GitHub link).
   - Pull Request **#456**: *“Migration of core modules to Spring 6.x”* shows a comprehensive approach to tackling dependency updates and annotations refactoring. Review the discussion for advice on handling legacy code issues during migration.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- **Review existing code** for `javax.*` package usage and update them to `jakarta.*`.
- **Ensure compatibility with Java 17** or higher before beginning migration.
- **Follow the migration checklist** in the Confluence guide to identify further dependencies or configurations that require updates.
- Run comprehensive **tests in a staging environment** to catch potential issues before deploying to production.
- Refer to the **code examples in recent GitHub commits** for best practices on modifying imports and handling deprecated features.

**Summary:**
This migration will affect package structures and may require code refactoring. Utilize the insights from Jira tickets for past learnings and refer to GitHub commits for real-life code change examples. Regularly update your Confluence documentation to reflect progress and any newly identified challenges during the migration.

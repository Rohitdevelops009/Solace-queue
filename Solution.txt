**Solution**:
- Develop an **AI-powered system** that consolidates information from Confluence, Jira, and GitHub into a unified interface.
- Implement a **user-friendly interface** where team members can input an issue or query directly.
- Integrate **data extraction mechanisms** to:
  - Access and retrieve relevant documentation from Confluence using keyword or semantic search.
  - Collect open and historical Jira tickets related to the query, including task status, assigned teams, and comments.
  - Cross-reference related GitHub commits, including code changes, pull requests, and associated discussions.
- Utilize **NLP models** to process and analyze extracted data, summarizing key insights from each source.
- **Prioritize and filter** the most relevant information to ensure users receive the most valuable insights.
- Present a **single-page response** that combines and organizes data from all three platforms.
- Include **recommended actions or next steps** within the response to guide users in resolving the issue efficiently.
- Ensure the system is capable of **real-time updates** to reflect any new changes or updates across Confluence, Jira, and GitHub.
- Implement **secure access and data handling** protocols to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of all accessed information.
